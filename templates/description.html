  <h1>Are You Our Next Rock Star Developer?</h1>

  We are a technology driven company where our technology is mostly still in our vision; our ideas and dreams of a brighter future for our customers. We will turn this vision into a customer platform that matches our customers to their perfect travel destinations and experiences. We are tracking user activity and these activities will feed into the process of creating the perfect travel package for that specific user.<br><br>
  What we are lacking is the code base and infrastructure to do this, and that’s the foremost reason for us hiring. Our business model has been tried out by us and it works, now we only need developers to help us build the tooling that is required for us to optimize our sales team.<br><br>
  The back office application is the first place that we have to get right; this is the tool our sales team needs to get to be able to quickly and efficiently start creating quotes and offers for our users. Currently this is a process that takes a bit too long for us to be able to scale the business efficiently. When this is done the fun part starts. Then we’ll start upgrading our current user facing web, add more tracking to build up our knowledgebase of user interaction and interests, and this will lead us to become even better at creating customised experiences for our customers out there.<br><br>
  Currently we have all the best business minds of the industry, now we have to get in the best technology minds, so you have a chance to join the best company of the travel industry and make us even better!<br><br>
  You will be working in our nice new office located just a handful of steps away from Aldgate East Underground Station, and that’s also where the interview will take place. The interview process will be short and sweet; interview with me, followed by a pair-programming session, and then topped off with a chat with our CEO.<br><br>
  If you are like me and panic over pair-programming sessions during interviews I can assure you, it will be relaxed, and since I want to hire you the session will be very relaxed. I want to try to find your strengths, not your weaknesses.<br><br>
  Kind regards,
  <br><br>
