<h1>Why You Will Want to Work For Us</h1>

Firstly and most importantly you’ll get to work on real products being used by real customers.  You’ll be contributing to daily releases, running and analysing experiments, monitoring and trouble-shooting our live websites.  You’ll be working on a wide range of technology in a cloud based environment. That means you’ll get to work on infrastructure (Azure/Amazon/Rackspace) as well as code and data.  We’re using a wide variety of technology and tend to be promiscuous about adopting new stuff.<br><br>
Our team is pretty flat in structure - we have a mentor in London responsible for training the staff, and imposing best practices and structures. We have three senior full-stack developers; Tanweer Ehsan and Zeeshan, who’s coding on the back office used by our sales team. We also have a friend in Manchester who’s designing and implementing parts of our user facing web. The ideal is that anyone can work on anything but, like most teams, we never quite reach that ideal and we have some people who are stronger on front-end stuff, some on back-end, while others are great with data and reporting.  We mix the teams to ensure we have the right skills in place.  You will be a developer but there will be no limit to the contribution you can make.<br><br>
We are working in an agile fashion according to the Scrum Processes with constant discussions between the London Team and Islamabad. I am trying to work together with the team and mentor them on a daily basis. Based on how the morning stand-up goes it might be obvious that some parts of the team are having problems, and if people are blocked I sit down with them and discuss different possible solutions to the problem. When solving these problems we often share desktops and have pair programming sessions, so as a developer you will never be standing alone while facing problems.<br><br>
